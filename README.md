# A/B Testing
Self-study to learn the processes of A/B Testing.

Scenario: A company has updated the "Click Here to Subscirbe" button across a random subset of their website users to attempt to make it easier for fans to see the button and subscribe to their content. Historically, about 12% of visitors who came to the site subscribed. With the new button, they are wanting to see the percent of subscribers increase by at least 3% before rolling out this feature to all users. They have tasked you with running an analysis to see if this new design outperforms the old design and attracts new subscribers - and conversely, they want to ensure that the new design is not potentially losing them subscribers either.

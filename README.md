# A/B Testing
Self-study to learn the processes of A/B Testing.

Scenario: A company has updated the "Click Here to Subscirbe" button across a random subset of their website users to attempt to make it easier for fans to see the button and subscribe to their content. Historically, about 12% of visitors who came to the site subscribed. With this new button, they are wanting to see that number increase by at least 3% to consider rolling out this feature to all site users. They have tasked you with running an analysis to see if this new design outperforms the old design and attracts new subscribers - and conversely, they want to ensure that the new design is not losing them subscribers either.
